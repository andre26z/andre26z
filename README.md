Hi, my name is André Augusto dos Santos.
I'm from Paraná Brasil and a front-end developer (JS,CSS,HTML).
I trie to learn something new everyday and work my creativity to get better results in my projects.
In Brasil i'm a lawyer, but technology always had a huge influence in my life so i decide to stop the inevitable and start to work with web development.
I hope to be able to show my work through this page and maybe even help someone.
I'm open to work and i have the will and the power to be a better piece of this puzzle we call life.
