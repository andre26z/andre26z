Hi, my name is André Augusto dos Santos.

I'm from Paraná, Brazil, and I am a front-end developer skilled in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Vue.js, Nuxt, React, and Next.js. I strive to learn something new every day, using my creativity to achieve better results in my projects.

In Brazil, I am also a lawyer, but technology has always played a significant role in my life. Eventually, I decided to embrace my passion for web development.

Through this page, I hope to showcase my work and perhaps even inspire or assist others. I am open to new opportunities and am eager to become a valuable contributor to the ever-evolving puzzle of life.
